# Tic-Tac-Toe

This Repo is basically a simple implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python Programming language. As the IRL Tic-Tac-Toe game, it allows 2 players to take turns marking X and O on a 3 x 3 grid. The first player to get 3 of their marks in either a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends with a tie.

## How to Run!
1. Python 3 is recommended to be installed in your machine
2. You can clone this repository or downdload the sourcec code as a ZIP file and extract it

## How to play!
- Once you have the code in hand, RUN the program. The Tic-Tac-Toe game program should look like this.

- After this, just play how normally you would play Tic-Tac-Toe

## Features
- Simple console-based gameplay
- 2 Player mode
- Checks for a win condition or tie to end the game.
- The game only ends if there is a winner. If the game ends in a tie, it will restart until a winner is found.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing it with a GUI using libraries such as Tkinter or Pygame
- Adding an A.I program opponent with various levels of difficulty.
- Keeping a scorecard to track the wins and losses.
